## Root packages

The root repo contains only packages needed for development. These are packages
used by the IDE, linters, transpilers, test suits, etc. Packages used by the
packages in this repo live in the package.json that is shipped with the actual
package itself.

E.g. React and Emotion should be dependencies of the actual package. This way
every package in the mono repo can choose which version of React to use. Notable
use case is Storybook which refuses to work with React 17.

- babel
- dotenv
- eslint (import, prettier, react, react-hooks)
- jest
- npm script helpers (npm-run-all, rimraf)
- prettier
- typescript and type packages
- webpack (cli, dev-server, html-webpack-plugin)

## Known issues

### Vscode React import

React 17 introduced a new JSX transform which does not require react to be
imported in every file. Support for this was added in TypeScript 4.1. However
vscode is still suggesting/requiring the react import before other JSX import
fixes are suggested.

Typescript 4.3 should solve this.
